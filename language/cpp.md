					<h1>C++</h1>
					<p>I studied C++ extensively during my three years of education, using it to experiment with game engine developmentâ€”from building a 2D physics engine to working with Vulkan for rendering and even creating a custom C++ engine for an FX-0-style space shooter running on the Switch. While I no longer use C++ professionally, it remains a go-to language for some of my personal projects, fueling my passion for low-level programming.</p>

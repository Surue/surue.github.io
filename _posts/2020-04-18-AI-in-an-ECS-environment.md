# Project recap
NÃ¢strond is a school project where me made a 2D dwarf city builder using a custom c++ engine made by our teacher. There was tasks:
- Simulating every building and their resources
- Making a tilemap system to draw on the screen
- A movable camera that would do frustum culling
- The simultation of all dwarfs, movements and decision, (my job)

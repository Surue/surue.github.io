# Recap of the projet
If throughout all those posts I've been mostly speaking about the engine itself, it's important to replace it into the scope of the full project. At the end of September 3 of my comrades, our teacher and myself stated talking about our specialization project. To sum it up it must be a 6 month project where everyone of us had the opportunity to go further it its favorite programming domains while doing a game with a custom engine.

# Pre - production

Even thought we were all eager to start programming as soon as possible, we had to do some basic management tasks in the project to set up everything properly. 
- Choose our job on the project
- Come up with an idea for the game
- Plan the whole project over the six next months

## The team

### Basics roles

The first task was to take every available roles and to start working with it. We had :
- A lead project that is also an engine programme. He then became latter a game programmer.
- A lead design, in charge of designing the game from the mechanics to the visual look of it. He is also a gameplay programmer
- A lead tool programmer/devops, working on tools and maintaning our repository
- A lead programmer who is also the lead engine programer (me)

Through the course of the three months the team changed a lot and the number keep increasing up to fifteen developers in total, mainly in the tool team. As I'm writing those line the team is counting three more members, two gameplay programmers and a tool programmer bringing up te total of developper to eight.

### Lead Programmer
If the title _Lead Programmer_ sounds big and powerful in practice it was simpler tasks:
- Managing the team and choosing our working tools
- Following the overall schedull decided by the lead project 
- Choose an overall coding style and phylosophy of coding
- Keep everyone beeing focused on the project

In the end this role took around 10% of my overall work and it was the most time-consuming at the start of the project while deciding how to structure the work and the organization. Later in the project, it was more a role of following everyone and taking decision to cut some features to prioritize another.

### Lead Engine

The seconds role was the real one. Beeing the _Lead Engine_ meant that the  whole architecture of every system, every tool, every object whould depend directly on how the implementation would be made. It also had an hidden task, to be fast enough to deliver something that could be used to make tool and a game withtout making anyone lose time. 

It was my main role during the whole project and the most stressing one because is something went wrong with it, it would trouble the rest of the team. It means that the absolute priority was to make sure the engine was working at anytime and if a bug/error was found by someone it had to be fixed as soon as possible. 

### Leading by the example

There is differents style of team leading, but beeing both the lead programmer and lead engine the code produced as those roles had to be on a top notch level because it would be look and copy be everyone else. It means that every bad practice would be automaticly reproduced and would take time to get ride of. 

The biggest problem was that in the course of 6 months only working with the same language, c++ in this case, the level of any one would rapidly increase. It meant that something that was _okish_ at the start of the project was a big _no no_ at the end. It grew frustration in some people that had done something at the start of the project and that couldn't to it anymore at the end. But it was still amazing to see the level of everyone increasing at a very fast pace.

## Planning & Management
The whole project used sprints of two weeks inspired by agile methode and for the prog' team was divised if four main steps

- Pre tool : A short periode where to main focus was on the engine
- Pre game : 2 months where the focus was on tools
- Game Critical : 2 months where every core feature needed to be implemented in the engine
- Game Plus : The final month allocated to do some enhancement on the game.

## The game
It was important for us to have the basics idea of the game because this would shape the engine and every tool needed. It would also deisgn the allocation of every human's resource we had.

Star Of Anarchy is a 3D rail shooter set up is space that is playable on the Switch. That was our original idea and the one we kept. of course we took ages to settle down on the final name, it means that every bit of code of document related to the name is simply using "The Game" to reference it.

# Production 

## Working at full speed with three differents teams

## Managing vacancy and health crisis

## Keeping everyone happy

# After Thoughs

## Planning at the start and planning at the end

## What I learnt

## Where to go now?

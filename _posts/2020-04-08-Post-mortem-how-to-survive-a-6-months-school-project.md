# Recap of the projet
If throughout all those posts I've been mostly speeking about the engine itself, it's important to replace it into the scope of the full project. At the end of Septembre 3 of my commarads, our teacher and myself stated talking about our specialization projet. To sum it up it must be a 6 months projet where everyone of us had the opportunity to go futher it it's favorite programming domaine while doing a game with a custom engine. 

# Pre - production

Eventhoug we were all eager to start programming as soon as possible, we had to do some basics task in the project to setup everything properly. 

## The team

### Basics roles

The first task was to take every available roles and to start working with it. We had :
- A lead project that would also be working as an engine programme then an game programmer
- A lead design, in charge of designing the game from the mechanics to the visual look of it. He would also be working as a gameplay programmer
- A tool programmer/devops
- A lead programmer who yould also be the engine programer (me)

Through the course of the three months the team changed a lot and the number keep increasing up to fifteen developers in total, mainly in the tool team. As I'm writing those line the team is counting three more members, two gameplay programmers and a tool programmer bringing up te total of developper to eight.

### Main tasks
If the title _Lead Prog_ sounds big and powerful in practice it was simpler task as managing the team, following the overall schedull decided by the lead project and sometimes remembering everyone to keep beeing focused on the project. An another part of the role implied to impose an overall coding style and phylosophy while implementing anything.

The seconds role was the real one. Beeing the _Lead Engine_ meant that the  whole architecture of every system, every tool, every object whould depend directly on how the implementation would be made. It also had an hidden task, to be fast enough to deliver something that could be used to make tool and a game withtout making anyone lose time. 

## Planning & Management
The whole project used sprints of two weeks inspired by agile methode and for the prog team was divised if four main steps

- Pre tool : A short periode where to main focus was on the engine
- Pre game : 2 months where the focus was on tools
- Game Critical : 2 months where every core feature needed to be implemented in the engine
- Game Plus : The final month allocated to do some enhancement on the game.

## The game
It was important for us to have the basics idea of the game because this would shape the engine and every tool needed. It would also deisgn the allocation of every human's resource we had.

Star Of Anarchy is a 3D rail shooter set up is space that is playable on the Switch. That was our original idea and the one we kept. of course we took ages to settle down on the final name, it means that every bit of code of document related to the name is simply using "The Game" to reference it.

# Production 

## Working at full speed with three differents teams

## Managing vacancy and health crisis

## Keeping everyone happy

# After Thoughs

## Planning at the start and planning at the end

## What I learnt

## Where to go now?

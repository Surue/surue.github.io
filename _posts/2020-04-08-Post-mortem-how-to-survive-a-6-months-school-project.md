# Recap of the projet
If throughout all those posts I've been mostly speeking about the engine itself, it's important to replace it into the scope of the full project. At the end of Septembre 3 of my commarads, our teacher and myself stated talking about our specialization projet. To sum it up it must be a 6 months projet where everyone of us had the opportunity to go futher it it's favorite programming domaine while doing a game with a custom engine. 

## Pre - production

If I'm a fast coder and someone 

### The team

The first task was take every available roles and to start working with it. We had :
- A lead project that would also be working as an engine programme then an game programmer
- A lead design, in charge of designing the game from the mechanics to the visual look of it. He would also be working as a gameplay programmer
- A tool programmer/devops
- A lead programmer who yould also be the engine programer (me)

Through the course of the 3 months the team changed a lot and the number keep increasing up to 15 developers in total, maily in the tool team. As I'm writing those line the team is counting 3 more members, 2 gameplaye programmers and a tool programmer.

### The game
After take our roles the first objectiv was to have a basic idea for the game. It was important for us to have this basics idea beacaus this would shape the engine and every tool needed.

Star Of Anarchy is a 3D rail shooter set up is space.

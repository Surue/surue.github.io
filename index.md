Hi, I'm Nicolas Schneider, passionated about custom game engine and video games in generals. You can see wat's following either as a showreel of my differents project or as a tutorial web pages containing differents works I'm breaking down.

If doing AI and PCG is my hobby I'm more of a core programmer.

# Majors projects

## AI groups movements and Pathfinding

During my last school year I've been working on a project that aim to use the new Unity burst compiler to its full potential by managing large group of agents and making them navigate in a large scale world. 
1. State of the art and existing solution
2. The game to test the project

## PokEngine

The PokEngine is a school's project mainly focus around making a game for Switch with a custom game engine. As the main engine programmer I visits some of the darkest secrets around the cheats used in the engin mixed with some optimization stuff. 
1. Pre-production
    1. [Overview of the engine in its current state]
2. Core Engine
    1. [Multithreading the engine]({% post_url 2020-04-13-How-to-make-more-in-the-same-time %})
2. Graphics Engine
    1. [Particle System]({% post_url 2020-04-07-Particle-systems %}) 
4. Post mortem
    1. [How to survive a 6 months school project]({% post_url 2020-04-08-Post-mortem-how-to-survive-a-6-months-school-project %}) 
    2. [One week later]({% post_url 2020-04-29-One-week-later %})


## Nàstrond

A small dwarf city builder made for a school project, the main focus was to get a maximum of dwarf moving resources around at the same time with a full behavior tree. I'm made an in-depth [study]({% post_url 2020-04-18-AI-in-an-ECS-environment %}) of how to optimized the pathinding and decision making of multiple dwarfs.

## Jam projects

### Ultigami
"Play as an origami's cat made from paper's pages. Transform into bird or fish to avoid danger and go as far as possible."\
Made during the Game Jam Du Temps in switzerland with the team Random Therapy. Our goal was to do a game together to see if we could work as a team. I was the only programmer and work to procedurally generate the level and the gameplay.

### Don't Forget
"A Die a Retry mixed with a 3D visual Novel game ! Play as Mamy, and discover what’s remains of your world. Interact with many things in your home, but don’t forget what’s important !"\ 
Made during the LD 41, our objectiv for the prog team was to get used to the scriptable object of unity. Implementing a whole system of event only based on them.

### Wish You Were Beer
"You're broke but thirsty, what a better solution than to steel beer from those who went to the bathroom."\
First game ever finished, it was my first experience working with a team, importing 3D models, applying materials, playing with lights and implementing the QTE system.

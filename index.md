# Self Introduction

I'm Nicolas Schneider, passionated about custom game engine and video games in generals. With those posts I'm presenting some aspects of the many projects I've been working. 

## AI groups movements and Pathfinding

During my last school year I've been working on a project that aim to use the new Unity burst compiler to its full potential by managing large group of agents and making them navigate in a large scale world. 
1. State of the art and existing solution
2. The game to test the project

## PokEngine

The PokEngine is a school's project mainly focus around making a game for Switch with a custom game engine. As the main engine programmer I visits some of the darkest secrets around the cheats used in the engin mixed with some optimization stuff. 
1. Pre-production
    1. [Overview of the engine in its current state]
2. Core Engine
    1. [Multithreading the engine]({% post_url 2020-04-13-How-to-make-more-in-the-same-time %})
2. Graphics Engine
    1. [Particle System]({% post_url 2020-04-07-Particle-systems %}) 
4. Post mortem
    1. [How to survive a 6 months school project]({% post_url 2020-04-08-Post-mortem-how-to-survive-a-6-months-school-project %}) 
    2. [One week later]({% post_url 2020-04-29-One-week-later %})


## NÃ strond

A small dwarf city builder made for a school project, the main focus was to get a maximum of dwarf moving resources around at the same time with a full behavior tree. I'm made an in-depth [study]({% post_url 2020-04-18-AI-in-an-ECS-environment %}) of how to optimized the pathinding and decision making of multiple dwarfs.

# Nicolas Schneider

Hi, I'm Nicolas Schneider, passionated about custom game engine and video games in generals. You can see wat's following either as a showreel of my differents project or as a tutorial web pages containing differents works I'm breaking down.

If doing AI and PCG is my hobby I'm more of a core programmer.

# Majors projects

## AI groups movements and Pathfinding

During my last school year I've been working on a project that aim to use the new Unity burst compiler to its full potential by managing large group of agents and making them navigate in a large scale world. 
1. State of the art and existing solution
2. The game to test the project

## PokEngine

The PokEngine is a school's project mainly focus around making a game for Switch with a custom game engine. As the main engine programmer I visits some of the darkest secrets around the cheats used in the engin mixed with some optimization stuff. 
1. Pre-production
    1. [Overview of the engine in its current state]

## NÃ strond

A small dwarf city builder made for a school project, the main focus was to get a maximum of dwarf moving resources around at the same time with a full behavior tree. I'm made an in-depth [study]({% post_url 2020-04-18-AI-in-an-ECS-environment %}) of how to optimized the pathinding and decision making of multiple dwarfs.

# Self Introduction

I'm Nicolas Schneider, passionated about custom game engine and video games in generals. With those posts I'm presenting some aspects of the many projects I've been working. 

## PokEngine

The PokEngine is a school's project mainly focus around making a game for Switch with a custom game engine. As the main engine programmer I visits some of the darkest secrets around the cheats used in the engin mixed with some optimization stuff.

## NÃ strond

A small dwarf city builder made for a school project, the main focus was to get a maximum of dwarf moving resources around at the same time with a full behavior tree. I'm made an in-depth [study]({% post_url 2020-04-18-AI-in-an-ECS-environment %}) of how to optimized the pathinding and decision making of multiple dwarfs.

title: Nicolas Schneider's Blog Post
---


I'm Nicolas Schneider, a game lover who love to understand how they're made. Currently a student at the SAE Institute of Genveva, I'm the king of guy who love doing technical stuff, the one working with AI, procedural generation.

Younger I've always dreamt of doing my own video game, but I find it too difficulty and I had no process to do them. So I started working with HTML & CSS when I was 10. Bit by bit I began to use PHP and thus begin a more complexe programmation style. Year laters I went to the EPFL, I stayed one year then left. It was not suiting me, I wanted to do someting more visual. I Found the SAE Institute Geneva the following year and became a gameplay programmer.

Since then I fall in love with the indi part of video game making and started to do as much as possible game jams. I also start working on different projects aside to the school. Then finnaly I shifted to being more a core programmer, loving all

# Majors projects

## AI groups movements and Pathfinding

During my last school year I've been working on a project that aim to use the new Unity burst compiler to its full potential by managing large group of agents and making them navigate in a large scale world. 
1. State of the art and existing solution
2. The game to test the project

## PokEngine

The PokEngine is a school's project mainly focus around making a game for Switch with a custom game engine. As the main engine programmer I visits some of the darkest secrets around the cheats used in the engin mixed with some optimization stuff. 
1. Pre-production

2. Core Engine

2. Graphics Engine
    1. [Particle System]({% post_url 2020-04-07-Particle-systems %}) 
4. Post mortem
    1. [How to survive a 6 months school project]({% post_url 2020-04-08-Post-mortem-how-to-survive-a-6-months-school-project %}) 
    2. [One week later]({% post_url 2020-04-29-One-week-later %})


## Nàstrond

A small dwarf city builder made for a school project, the main focus was to get a maximum of dwarf moving resources around at the same time with a full behavior tree. I'm made an in-depth [study]({% post_url 2020-04-18-AI-in-an-ECS-environment %}) of how to optimized the pathinding and decision making of multiple dwarfs.

## School projects

### Space Infestation
"As an vicious Alien, infest a spaceship to turn it into your new nest, fight robots and get acces to the main generator."\ 
I worked with 3D procedural generation, meaning all problems going with it (AI navigation, Lights, Collider, optimisation). I also implemented a texture painter, allowing the player to paint a texture on top of a another one.

### [Nightmare Pop!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/808020/Nightmare_Pop/)
"Play as Clementine, a little girl trapped in her own nightmare, but don't forget that all those monster are played by twitch viewers"\
I mainly work with the core gameplay, implementing twitch and adding AI

### [Space Dwarf](https://github.com/Surue/SpaceDwarfs)
"As a dwarf for deep space, explore planet to mine their ressource. But your old nemesis is back, the goblin space"\
Working with the procedural generation for all levels(BFS, Cellular Automata). AI: pathfinding (A*)

## Jam projects

### [Ultigami](https://randomtherapy.itch.io/ultigami.html)
"Play as an origami's cat made from paper's pages. Transform into bird or fish to avoid danger and go as far as possible."\
Made during the Game Jam Du Temps in switzerland with the team Random Therapy. Our goal was to do a game together to see if we could work as a team. I was the only programmer and work to procedurally generate the level and the gameplay.

### [Don't Forget](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/dont-forget)
"A Die a Retry mixed with a 3D visual Novel game ! Play as Mamy, and discover what’s remains of your world. Interact with many things in your home, but don’t forget what’s important !"\ 
Made during the LD 41, our objectiv for the prog team was to get used to the scriptable object of unity. Implementing a whole system of event only based on them.

### Wish You Were Beer
"You're broke but thirsty, what a better solution than to steel beer from those who went to the bathroom."\
First game ever finished, it was my first experience working with a team, importing 3D models, applying materials, playing with lights and implementing the QTE system.

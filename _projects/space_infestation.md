excerpt: "As an vicious Alien, infest a spaceship to turn it into your new nest, fight robots and get acces to the main generator." I worked with 3D procedural generation, meaning all problems going with it (AI navigation, Lights, Collider, optimisation). I also implemented a texture painter, allowing the player to paint a texture on top of a another one.

excerpt: Group project where we made a 3D space ship procedural interior proceduraly generated.
description: As an vicious Alien, infest a spaceship to turn it into your new nest, fight robots and get acces to the main generator. I worked with <b>3D procedural generation</b>, meaning all problems going with it (AI navigation, Lights, Collider, optimisation). I also implemented a <b>texture painter</b>, allowing the player to paint a texture on top of a another one.

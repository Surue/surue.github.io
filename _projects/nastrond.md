excerpt: This is a school project where we had 3 months to do a city builder with dwarf. I was in charge of the <b>AI</b> in general, from the <b>decisions making to the pathfinding</b>. This project was our first where we worked with a <b>custom game engine</b> - made by our teacher - and had to have a vision outside from the game that we could have with a Unity's project.

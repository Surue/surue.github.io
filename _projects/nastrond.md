This is a school project where we had 3 months to do a city builder with dwarf. I was in charge of the AI in general, from the decisions making to the pathfinding. This project was our 
first where we worked with a custom game engine - made by our teacher - and had to have a vision outside from the game that we could have with a Unity's project.

# Overview
This project might not be the most interesting one, but this was my **first ever finshed game**. It's this project made with people I don't even know only 2 months after I started to learn coding and doing video game that show me what I could do with the few things I knew at the time.  

Just with this game I learnt:
- Importing 3D models
- How materials works
- Creating a QTE system 
- Working with git with someone else

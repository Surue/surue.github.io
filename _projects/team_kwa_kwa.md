# Overview
I've been hired for 6 months from september 2018 to february 2019 to help with the early development of a **prototype for the new project** of [Team Kwa Kwa](https://team-kwakwa.com/). During this time I had the opportunity to go to two b2b event with the company, the [Nordic Game Conference](https://conf.nordicgame.com/) and the [Ludicious Festival](http://www.ludicious.ch/). In both those events I held the stand and pitched the game to the other developers. 

# AI and PCG
A previous part of the game included differents island and the possibility to navigate between them, during the 6 months my job was to try **differents technics to create the world**. I also worked in cooperation with the artist to build the world and together we came up with the final look of the world and how it worked.

Once the main structure of the world was decided I also implemented differents autonoumous boat with their own **state machine and pathfinding** algorithms. The implementation was quickly and the part that took most of the time was to achieve a feeling to be on water have to have coherent movement based on this.

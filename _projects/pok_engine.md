This is a 6 months school project we made in our third year. The objective was to do a game (Stars of Anarchy) running on the Nintendo Switch using a custom game engine (Pok Engine). We separated the team in
three main groups, Game, Tool and Engine. I was leading the overall team and also more specifically the engine's team. I implemented most of the core feature used in 
the engine as the graphic engine, physics engine, entity manager, resource manager, and so on.

excerpt: This is a 6 months school project we made in our third year. The objective was to do a game (Stars of Anarchy) running on the Nintendo Switch using a custom game engine (PokEngine). We separated the team in three main groups, Game, Tool and Engine. I was leading the overall team and also more specifically the engine's team. I implemented most of the core feature used in the engine as the graphic engine, physics engine, entity manager, resource manager, and so on.

## Overview
The Pok's project is a 6 months school project were my and other students had to make a 3D game engine that could run on the switch. You can have a look at some of the articles I've written about it.

1. [My first article]({% post_url 2020-04-13-How-to-make-more-in-the-same-time %}) is about the overall multithreading of the engine. 
2. You can also read [here]({% post_url 2020-04-07-Particle-systems %}) how I approach the implementation of a particle system.
3. Finally I wrote a [first post mortem] ({% post_url 2020-04-08-Post-mortem-how-to-survive-a-6-months-school-project %}) mainly focused around different solution to have a professional environnment while still being in school. I also write a [second post mortem]({% post_url 2020-04-08-Post-mortem-how-to-survive-a-6-months-school-project %}) which focus more around our main mistake and what I would do differently.

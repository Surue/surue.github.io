# Overview
This is a **VR Game** that can be played on the Samsung Gear VR or the Occulus Rift with wo player. **One player is with the headset** and is trapped inside a dungeon while **the other player is on a tablet** and try to kill the firrst player by spawning monster. I was hired for 1 month to help the team finish the game before the launch.

# My job
I had three main job with the team:
- Building a new level and working with two artists to produce every assets
- Implementing the three monster specific to this level
- Reworking every system to support the new level

This was my **first professional experience** and it teached me the deadline that occure when working with this type of project. This was also my first time working on a VR Game and it teached me a lot about optimization whether it be in my code or with the 3D assets.

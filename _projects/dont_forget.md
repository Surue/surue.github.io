# Overview
This is a *die and retry* game mixed with *visual novel* elements where you play as a grandmother that needs to remember her daily routines to don't forget anything. In this game I mainly focused on building the "quest" system and the differents events of the day. This system use scriptable object to have a generic manager that can handle any type of events. With this game I learnt:
- Building an events system based on Scriptable Object
- Implementation of a dialog system
